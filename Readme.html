<h3 class="western">Server Description</h3>
<p>The server program is a multithreaded application that performs
socket reads, socket writes, and process work asynchronously. The
majority of the code simply reacts to asynchronous actions being
completed. C++ 11 is used extensively throughout the program. <i>Futures</i><span style="font-style: normal">
are used to access the result of three out of four of the
asynchronous actions. Only the asynchronous socket accept of new
connections is dealt with using a callback. The new </span><i>thread</i><span style="font-style: normal">
functionality is used to kick off the loop responsible for managing
the reads, writes, and work tasks. For easy thread launching when a
new primality test is requested, the </span><i>async</i><span style="font-style: normal">
function is used. The results of the operation are stored in a
</span><i>future</i><span style="font-style: normal">. </span><span style="font-style: normal">Memory
management came easy with C++11’s </span><i>shared_ptr</i><span style="font-style: normal">.</span></p>
<h3 class="western">Libraries Utilized</h3>
<p>To perform the networking requirements I chose the <span style="font-style: normal"><b>asio</b></span>
library contained within <span style="font-style: normal"><b>boost</b></span>.
This networking library simplified the code needed to handle
asynchronous socket operations. I was pleased that the library
allowed <span style="font-style: normal">C++11’s </span><i>future</i><span style="font-style: normal">s
to be used to access the result of asynchronous operations. The asio
boost library can be found at </span><span style="font-style: normal"><a href="http://www.boost.org/">http://www.boost.org/</a>.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-style: normal">For the large integer and
primality testing I chose to use the NTL library. </span><span style="font-style: normal">It
was far too convenient that this library happened to have large
integer support and primality testing within it. The creator appeared
to make the library as efficient as possible and, seeing how the
majority of the processing would be in primality testing, this was
important. The NTL library can be found at <a href="http://www.shoup.net/ntl/">http://www.shoup.net/ntl/</a>.
The GMP library found at <a href="https://gmplib.org/">https://gmplib.org/</a></span>
is a dependency of the NTL library. 
</p>
<p>The GMP and NTL libraries are both licensed under the LGPL. The
restrictions on this license allow for commercial use as long as the
application is dynamically linking to the library.</p>
<h3 class="western">Improvements Required</h3>
<ul>
	<li/>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0cm; line-height: 100%">The code
	contains very little error handling. The library calls made to asio
	can throw exceptions and some of the exceptions will end up stored
	in the <i>future</i> objects. None of the <i>future</i><font face="Liberation Serif, serif"><span style="font-style: normal">s</span></font><span style="font-style: normal">
	are currently checked for exceptions.<br/>
</span><br/>

	</p>
	<li/>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0cm; line-height: 100%">The closing
	of client connections is not sufficiently handled and memory is not
	currently cleaned up in the server when a client closes.<br/>
<br/>

	</p>
	<li/>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0cm; line-height: 100%">The dynamic
	memory expansion and contraction of the vector in <font face="FreeMono, monospace">ClientConnection</font>
	is not an efficient way to buffer reads. The best way would be a
	static amount of memory that is allocated on connection acceptance.
	The dynamic memory handling of vectors made it convenient to accept
	integers of any size. The NTL’s big integer can contain integers
	of 2^64 bits in size.<br/>
<br/>

	</p>
	<li/>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0cm; line-height: 100%">Both the
	server and client programs must be terminated utilizing <b>ctrl + c</b><span style="font-weight: normal">.
	A better way of notifying processes and threads of a program
	termination request would be required.<br/>
</span><br/>

	</p>
	<li/>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0cm; line-height: 100%">The client is
	rudimentary and only currently performs one request at a time. This
	can be changed to make the client make multiple requests before
	waiting for responses since the server is very much capable of doing
	so. My plans were to write a several more clients that would
	generate many requests from random integers and generate requests
	based on a file list of numbers. All network operations on the
	client block but this doesn’t mean multiple requests can’t be
	made from one client.<br/>
<br/>

	</p>
	<li/>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0cm; line-height: 100%">The server
	will spawn a new thread for every primality test. Thread creation,
	depending on the OS, can be expensive. To counter this expense, it
	is possible to use C++11’s <i>packaged_task</i>s to wait until a
	previous request completes before starting the next. In other words,
	the number of primality tests being performed can be throttled no
	matter how many requests come in. Another reason to do this is
	context switching overhead. Depending on the OS and how the OS
	schedules threads, it is possible that when the number of program
	threads far exceed the core count of a processor the OS will context
	switch between threads frequently to give each thread a  slice of
	CPU time.

directory and the command ldconfig run, depending on the system.
Alternatively, the libraries and their development packages can be
installed by a package manager. A makefile is provided to build the
server and client in this project.</p>
